# Problem Statement

Travel planning often involves estimating multiple expenses such as fuel cost, ticket charges, accommodation, and daily spending.  
Manually computing these values leads to errors, inaccurate budgeting, and inconvenience for travelers.

The **Travel Cost Estimator** aims to provide an automated and modular solution that calculates the estimated total travel cost based on user inputs such as distance, vehicle type, mileage, fuel price, accommodation cost, and per-day spending.

This project applies core software engineering principles including modular design, UML documentation, validation mechanisms, and structured workflow modeling.

# Scope of the Project

### ✔ In Scope
- A complete Python application with modular structure  
- CLI-based user interaction  
- Fuel-based and ticket-based travel modes  
- Cost calculation engine  
- Validation of all inputs  
- UML diagrams (Class, Sequence, Architecture)  
- PDF report generation  
- Unit test suite  
- Readable and maintainable code  
- Extensible design supporting future web or GUI integration  

### ❌ Out of Scope
- Real-time API integration (fuel prices, maps, distance)  
- Live ticket booking or travel reservation  
- Mobile application  
- Advanced predictive ML models
